Special build instruction for this JNI benchmark.

Taking z/OS as an example:

1. Do an Ant build from Eclipse and get a Bumblebench.jar
2. Copy the Bumblebench.jar to your target machine and unzip it. This is to extract the needed scripts to build JNI native libraries and run the tests.
3. export SDK_DIR=/path/to/your/SDK
4. Go to JNI-test-scripts/zos/ folder and run build-dll.sh. This script builds the DLL libraries.
5. To run tests, execute JNI-test-scripts/zos/run-jni-test.sh. This also requires SDK_DIR.
